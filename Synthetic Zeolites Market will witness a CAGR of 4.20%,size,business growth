Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the synthetic zeolites market will witness a CAGR of 4.20% for the forecast period of 2021-2028. Increased need and demand for synthetic zeolites for a wide range of applications, rising demand for synthetic zeolites from the detergent industry and significant usage of synthetic zeolites for catalytic cracking in the petroleum industry are the major factors attributable to the growth of the synthetic zeolites market.

Zeolites are considered to be 100% safe and non-toxic in nature. These are a collection of raw materials having porous framework that makes them appropriate for employment in petrochemical, detergents, and others. Majorly containing silicon and aluminium compounds, zeolites are also used as dietary supplements to cure diarrhoea, autism, herpes, and cancer. These are also used to balance the level of pH in the body and remove heavy metals. Zeolites are hydrated aluminium silicates that are available in both natural and synthetic forms. However, synthetic zeolites have a larger range of properties and wider cavities.  Synthetic zeolites are increasingly being used as alternatives to phosphates in the process of detergent manufacturing.
